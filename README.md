# secrectword
This project introduces a guessing game developed using React, where players are challenged to decipher a hidden word. A word is displayed with blank spaces representing its letters. Players attempt to guess the letters one by one, receiving immediate feedback on the correctness of their guesses. If they guess a letter correctly, it is filled in the correct positions of the word. The objective is to unveil the complete word within a defined number of attempts, encouraging logical thinking and deduction.
